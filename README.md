This repo is a source code of the `distill` blog. It contains articles I have written about these topics that I am fascinated in and excited to share:
  - Causal Inference,
  - Bayesian Methods, and
  - Machine Learning


It is very much a work in progress. Things may change quickly and often.

It can serve as my portfolio. The goal is to reproduce, modify, synthesize, and adapt to the lectures/readings or related work as a research assistant.

All datasets used, of course, were public data, and we can easily find them throughout the Google search.

I welcome readers to comment/question (in process).
