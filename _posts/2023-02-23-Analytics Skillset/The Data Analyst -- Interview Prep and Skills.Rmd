## Thoughts 

As a biostatistician role, we also play Data Analysts. With comprehensive and deep knowledge of statistics, we apply available methods and choose the proper method or, if necessary, modify/create a new approach to drive the data into a story that fits.

In general, Steve Olson's Talk (CCASA Presentation) could tell us about essential requirements to prepare skills and interview for the data analyst.

## Goal of the Data Analyst

The Goal of the Analyst is to generate insights from available data *in service of improving the company or brand Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), goals, metrics*    

- Understanding a brand or company's KPIs and/or goals is foundational as all analytics are conducted in service of KPIs and identifying opportunities to improve the metrics  
   * Commerce: Monthly sales, revenue, margin or profit, steal share from specific competitors   
   * Marketing: Engagement (CRM) such as email open rates or click through rates, revenue, new names generated  

- Examples of questions to be answered through analytics:  
   * How are the KPIs trending?  
   * Where can we increase sales?  
   * Where is engagement strong or lacking?  
   
## How to understand the Data

<span style="text-decoration:underline">__All analytics start with a full understanding of the underlying data__</span>   

- How to "break down" a dataset:  
   
   1- Know the __exhaustive set of variables and data__ with which you are working   
   
   + Data dictionary is sometimes a good starting point -- often will just be high level description and format  
   + How are different data sets linked? What are the primary keys? (individual id, phone number, store id)  
         
   2- __Calculate basic metrics__ to fully understand the data -- up to 90% of analytic work -- Discovery or EDA   
   
   + Calculate means and medians for each variable  
   + Create distribution metrics of each variable: standard deviations, interquartile ranges etc  
   + Data ranges  
   + Survey data -- know the possible answers to each question, the scale  
   + Uncover questionable data: missing data, miscoded or incorrect data, outliers  
   + Create cross tabs   
         
   3- __Visualize__ the distribution of data in the variables   
   
   + Create graphs of distribution frequencies, histograms   
   
## Approach to Analytics 

<span style="text-decoration:underline">__A single number or metric or datapoint is not an insight__</span>    

Metrics require CONTEXT to know it it is "good or bad"  

<span style="text-decoration:underline">__Analytic approaches to create context:__</span>  

1- <span style="text-decoration:underline">Benchmarking</span> against past similar timeframes or events   

   + Compare to last year (YoY), Past promotion comparison, Previous month average  
   
2- <span style="text-decoration:underline">Trending</span> over time -- is the metric increasing or decreasing?   

   + line graphs of : past 12 months, year over year   
   + cohort analysis -- Q1 engaged, did they engage in Q2, Q3 etc   
3- Segmenting the data: how does the metric look for different segments?  

   + Age groups  
   + Purchase segments  
   + High, medium, low engagement tiers  
   
4- <span style="text-decoration:underline">Industry benchmarks</span> or comparisons  

5- Create maps to determine if there are <span style="text-decoration:underline">geographical</span> differences  

6- <span style="text-decoration:underline">Cumulative response distributions</span> - linear growth or plateau  

7- <span style="text-decoration:underline">Test results</span> -- how did group A perform vs group B?  

## Creating Valuable Analytic Output

- Think about the numbers in terms of __telling a story__  
   + "The metric appears to be trending in this direction, this might be why, and here is what I think we should do"   
- __Make recommendations__ -- what recommendations do you have because of the story in the data and how might we alter the KPIs ore metrics favorably?   
   + Because the metrics are doing this, we should consider doing this  
- __Generate hypotheses__ -- if information is lacking to make a firm recommendation -- why might things be trending the way they are -- be provocative  
   + The metrics may be trending this way because  
   + Is there other data that could help explain what you are seeing?   
- __Propose testing__ -- where appropriate to evaluate hypotheses -- can a test be set up to confirm or disprove the hypothesis?  

## Test and Learn Principles

- Identity A) the metric to change and B) the feature(s) which, if changed, may improve the metric  
   + Increase open rates: modify subject lines/preview text  
   + Increase online conversion/purchase: add purchase message pop ups or abandon cart messaging  
   + Increase sales: increase discount amounts  
- Generate a hypothesis -- if we change this, this will happen  
- Understand the engagement or purchase funnel  
   + Is there enough sample to get a read on results?   
- Statistical testing  
   + Understand statistical vs. practical significant -- effect size vs. P values  
   + Is the result sizeable enough to warrrant making the change?  
   + Random sampling is vital   

## Skills & Tools

__Speak the "language" of the different tools you might use__ -- may not need to be an expert  

- Know the basic functions within SQL ana what they do  
   * select, from, where  
   * different joins and what they do -- frequent interview question   

- Familiarize yourself with different analytic tools   
   * Visualization tools: Excel, Tableau, PowerBI  
   * Web analysis: Adobe analytics, Google analytics  
   * Statistical languages: R, Python  
   
- Prepare an example for when you learned something similar quickly to be successful   

## Soft skills  

- Attributes of the Valuable Data Analyst  
   * Curiosity - about the business and the metrics  
      + You are hungry to understand what is the data telling you  
      + You have an appetite for knowing what you can learn from the data  
   * Creativity -- with data and output  
      + Excited to explore different ways to visualize data  
      + Ability to explain the findings -- you may need to present the data to non-data experts  
   * Attention to detail   
      + Data errors are easy to make -- always double check the work and get others' feedback  
      + Code running without error is not enough -- validate the output   
   * Ability to have __"Big Picture" view__  
      + Step back and ask yourself if the numbers you are presenting make sense  
      + Gui check -- refer to other work, as others for input  
      
## Questions to ask during the interview

* What kind of data will I be working with?  
   + CRM engagement, sales data, media spend, what level (household, individual, store)   
* How is the data structured?  
   + Relational tables?
   + What are the different datasets?  
   + How are different tables linked? (primary keys)  
* What are the Key Performance Indicators we are trying to improve?   
* Will I be presenting the data and results and who is the audience?  
   + Will I be working with others to tell the story?  
* What analytic tools are used most often in daily work?
