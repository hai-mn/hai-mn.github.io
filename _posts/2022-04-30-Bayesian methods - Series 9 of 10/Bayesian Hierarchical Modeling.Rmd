## An example

Define the model.  

In this model there there are 2 different prior distributions for the data parameter θ
.
For m=1
 the prior is concentrated around ω1=0.25
 and for m=2
 the prior is concentrated around ω2=0.75
.
Concentration levels are the same κ=12
.
The resulting parameters of beta distribution are: (α1=3.5,β1=8.5)
 and (α2=8.5,β2=3.5)
, correspondingly.

Create list of data corresponding to 6 successes out of 9 trials.
