  <h3>About</h3>
  <p>
     Hello! I'm Hai Nguyen, a Ph.D. candidate in Biostatistics at the University of Illinois at Chicago. I am also working as a RA at Methodology Research Core - Institute for Health Research and Policy. I am very interesting in Causal inference, Bayesian methods, and Machine learning. I sometimes write "short articles" about these topics in this blog.
