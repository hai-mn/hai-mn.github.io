  <h3>About</h3>
  <p>
     Hello! I'm Hai Nguyen, a Ph.D. candidate in Biostatistics at the University of Illinois at Chicago. I am also working as a RA at Methodology Research Core - Institute for Health Research and Policy.
  <p>
      I am fascinated by Causal Inference, Longitudinal and Latent Trait Modeling, Bayesian Methods, Machine Learning. Hence, sometimes I write a post about these topics in this blog besides the study and work time.
